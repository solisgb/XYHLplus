# XYHLplus
A progressive improvement of XYHL.

The data come from:

1) The module XYplus_parameters, with the variables that control each execution.
2) A xml file where the specific projects are stored.
3) An Ms. Access DB. You cau use any other DB supported by pyodbc.

But I feel this soft project is very specific.
